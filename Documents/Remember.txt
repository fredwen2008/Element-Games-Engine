Remember:
- Def need frustum culling and other culling in general, seriously!
- Add vertex culling and pixel culling to all shaders since opengl can't do it for me in deferred renderer!
- Add Camera to Light for shadow mapping!
- Create a way to add shaders outside of the renderer class!
- GUI Focus
- Awesomium Backspace Key
- Atmospheric Scattering
- Deferred Rendering Needs Multipass lighting on Translucent Objects that get Lighting
    - Done but not fully tested!
    - Render Translucent Lighting separate from Decal just like deferred pipeline
- Implement General Tessellation Displacement Mapping (from height map)
- Light shafts when in atmosphere
- Reflections & Refractions
- Bounce Lighting
- Make it so you can at least the emissiveness of a translucent non-lit mesh-material
- Finish Python Bindings and Maintain Them, Or parse python scripts inside engine
- Check for shader changes in separate thread and re-compile/link them in when they do change!
	- This should be an option turned on and compiled in!!! (Avoids visual hacking!)
- Omni Directional Shadow Mapping
- Culling of distant objects in shadow map rendering and backfaces in shader?
- JSON Based Scene Format
- Picking in Editor on Non-Physics Objects (Bounding Box Automatically Generated!)
- Separate all transparent rendering and draw it in depth first order!
- Separate Game Updating and Rendering into separate threads at least!
    - Possibly make job queue system which just picks the next available core!
    - Also, probably need more threads
        - Rendering, Animation/Physics, Networking, Input, Data Input, Data Output, Audio, AI/GameLogic
    - This will demand pipelinging
        - Only have 3 copies of data, one for what's being rendered, and two for buffers
            - If renderer is currently rendering from data, then write directly to next data set
            - If renderer is currently copying next buffer to current, then render to third data set
            - This might have some timing issues, especially is renderer moves way too fast, we'll see.
- Decals or Mega texture?!? Texture Painting?!?
    - Growable Decal Megatexture?
- Texture Repeat in Rendering Material
