Remember:
- Def need frustum culling and other culling in general, seriously!
- Add vertex culling and pixel culling to all shaders since opengl can't do it for me in deferred renderer!
- Add Camera to Light for shadow mapping!
- Create a way to add shaders outside of the renderer class!
- GUI Focus
- Awesomium Backspace Key
- Atmospheric Scattering
- Deferred Rendering Needs Multipass lighting on Translucent Objects that get Lighting
	- Done but not fully tested!
- Implement General Tessellation Displacement Mapping (from height map)
- Light shafts when in atmosphere
- Reflections & Refractions
- Bounce Lighting
- Make it so you can at least the emissiveness of a translucent non-lit mesh-material
- Finish Python Bindings and Maintain Them, Or parse python scripts inside engine
- Check for shader changes in separate thread and re-compile/link them in when they do change!
	- This should be an option turned on and compiled in!!! (Avoids visual hacking!)
- Omni Directional Shadow Mapping
- JSON Based Scene Format
- Picking in Editor on Non-Physics Objects (Bounding Box Automatically Generated!)
- Separate all transparent rendering and draw it in depth first order!
