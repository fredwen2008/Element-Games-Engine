Remember:
- XML or scripting language parsing
	Perhaps python bindings
- Def need frustum culling and other culling in general, seriously!
- Add Camera to Light for shadow mapping!
- Textures are definitely loaded upside down, this will definitely affect the order of the cube maps too!
- Definitely need to add transformations to meshes (and rigid bodies later) too
- Create a way to add shaders outside of the renderer class to a specific renderer type! Define in the material?
- GUI Focus
- Multiple Documents in RocketInterface

Profiling and Other Optimizations, moved to git as well:
