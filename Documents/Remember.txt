Remember:
- XML or scripting language parsing
	Perhaps python bindings
- Def need frustum culling and other culling in general, seriously!
- Add Camera to Light for shadow mapping!
- Definitely need to add transformations to meshes (and rigid bodies later) too
- Create a way to add shaders outside of the renderer class to a specific renderer type! Define in the material?
    - Also, need a way to define a function which determines which shader gets used for this as well, aka, atmospheric shading from inside or outside the atmosphere
- GUI Focus
- Awesomium Backspace Key
- Fix cube mapping for spheres now that textures are loaded properly
    - This involves fixing the texture generation so there's not a 1 pixel border of weird stuff around the edge of generated textures
- Atmospheric Scattering
- Deferred Rendering Needs Multipass lighting on Translucent Objects that get Lighting
- Fix window resizing
- Impelement Specular Mapping
- Implement General Tessellation Displacement Mapping (from height map)
- Light shafts when in atmosphere
- Reflections & Refractions
- Bounce Lighting

Profiling and Other Optimizations, moved to git as well:
gprof... don't forget to compile with -pg!
