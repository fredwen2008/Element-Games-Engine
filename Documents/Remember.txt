Remember:
- XML or scripting language parsing
	Perhaps python bindings
- Def need frustum culling and other culling in general, seriously!
- Add Camera to Light for shadow mapping!
- Definitely need to add transformations to meshes (and rigid bodies later) too
- Create a way to add shaders outside of the renderer class to a specific renderer type! Define in the material?
- GUI Focus
- Awesomium Backspace Key
- Fix cube mapping for spheres now that textures are loaded properly
- Specular component gets lost when decal is dark, even if material specularity is high! This is in composition.frag!

Profiling and Other Optimizations, moved to git as well:
gprof... don't forget to compile with -pg!
google-perftools
valgrind
perf - linux-tools


valgrind --tool=callgrind myprog

gprof build/Applications/Tests/Sandbox/element_games_sandbox | python gprof2dot.py | dot -Tpng -o gprof.png

On Improving the Animation:
Should remember previous timestamp/frame index for each bone and component, and unless the new timestamp is less than the current one, it should always start at the previous frame index for searching for the right frame to use.
