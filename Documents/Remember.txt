Remember:
- XML or scripting language parsing
	Perhaps python bindings
- Def need frustum culling and other culling in general, seriously!
- Add Camera to Light for shadow mapping!
- Definitely need to add transformations to meshes (and rigid bodies later) too
- Create a way to add shaders outside of the renderer class to a specific renderer type! Define in the material?
    - Also, need a way to define a function which determines which shader gets used for this as well, aka, atmospheric shading from inside or outside the atmosphere
- GUI Focus
- Awesomium Backspace Key
- Fix cube mapping for spheres now that textures are loaded properly
- Specular component gets lost when decal is dark, even if material specularity is high! This is in composition.frag!
    - Fix by storing specular map in separate FBO

Profiling and Other Optimizations, moved to git as well:
gprof... don't forget to compile with -pg!
google-perftools
valgrind
perf - linux-tools


valgrind --tool=callgrind myprog
