Remember:
- Def need frustum culling and other culling in general, seriously!
- Add Camera to Light for shadow mapping!
- Definitely need to add transformations to meshes (and rigid bodies later) too
- Create a way to add shaders outside of the renderer class!
- GUI Focus
- Awesomium Backspace Key
- Atmospheric Scattering
- Deferred Rendering Needs Multipass lighting on Translucent Objects that get Lighting
	- Done but not fully tested!
- Implement General Tessellation Displacement Mapping (from height map)
- Light shafts when in atmosphere
- Reflections & Refractions
- Bounce Lighting
- Make it so you can at least the emissiveness of a translucent non-lit mesh-material
- Finish Python Bindings and Maintain Them, Or parse python scripts inside engine
