If you are building this on a 64 bit windows platform. I have provided the prebuilt libraries as well as headers and binaries required to built this project yourself with MinGW. I normally do my development under Linux but seeing how this project is designed to be cross platform, I might as well make it easy to write and compile this code everywhere.
